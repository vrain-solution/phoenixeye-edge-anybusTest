Before proceeding to plug in and use the ABCC Option Card with the STM3240G-EVAL
board please consult the quick start guide as there are neccessary hardware
changes for the device to function properly. Failure to perform these actions may
result in hardware failure.

This is a demo application of the HMS ABCC SDK

 Target Platform:
    STM3240G-EVAL Board with HMS ABCC Option Card

 Platform BSP Version:
    STM32Cube FW_F4 V1.7.0

 Development Environment:
    IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM v7.70.1

 This demo is delivered with a preconfigured application example, "appl_adimap_board_io.c"
 that interfaces with various peripherals that exist on the STM32 Eval Board as well as the
 Option Card. These peripherals include:
 - 3 HEX Switches (connected to I2C1 via an I2C IO-Expander)
 - 12 LEDs (connected to I2C1 via an I2C IO-Expander)
 - 8 I/Os (all used as outputs) (connected to I2C1 via an I2C IO-Expander)
 - 1 Momentary Pushbutton (Key)
 - 1 Potentiometer (RV1)
 - 1 Internal timer (TIM5)

 This demo additionally makes use of the following peripherals:
 - The MB785 graphical LCD module (connected to FSMC chip select 3)

 Supported operating modes:
 - Serial (on UART6)
 - SPI (on SPI2)
 - 8-bit/16-bit Parallel (on FSMC chip select 1)
